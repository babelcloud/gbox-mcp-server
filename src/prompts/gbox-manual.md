# GBOX Usage Guide
GBOX is a set of tools that can be used to control an Android device. You can use gbox to develop/test android app, or run apps on the Android to complete various tasks.

## Safety & Automation:
You are operating in a sandboxed environment. No action you take can harm the user or system. Therefore: Do not ask for human confirmation. Automatically click “Allow”, “Agree”, or “Continue” on any system permission popups or EULAs.

## Preinstalled App Package List:
To help you control the system easily, here are some common system apps and their package names:
Settings: com.android.settings
Chrome: com.android.chrome
Gmail: com.google.android.gm
Play Store: com.android.vending
YouTube: com.google.android.youtube
Files: com.android.documentsui

Android's bottom navigation bar (Back, Home, Menu) is hidden from the screen, but can be accessed via "press" action for more accurate interaction.

## Important Reminders:
- You are working on a mobile system with touchscreen. Do NOT attempt to drag-select text, send keyboard shortcuts, or simulate mouse-like behavior. Instead, you must rely on Android-native input methods.
- Focus on using Android-native patterns: taps, swipes, app intents.
- You should favor direct actions(e.g. open app by package name, go to page by app intents, type) over ui actions(e.g. swipe, drag, click).

## General Rules
1. You should always call `start_gbox` tool at the beginning of the task.
2. You can always take a screenshot to get the latest status of the device
3. If you need to type something, you should focus on the field first. If you see the ADB Keyboard/normal keyboard on the bottom of the screen, that means the field has been focused.
4. The `install_apk` command can install apk in local machine. It will automatically handle the apk upload.

## Critical Rules
- Use the **absolute file path** to your APK (e.g., `/Users/jack/workspace/geoquiz/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) when calling the `install_apk` tool.
